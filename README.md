# Investigating Failed SSH Logins with Splunk

## üìå Project Overview
For the company Buttercup Games, I was tasked with identifying potential security issues related to failed SSH login attempts on the mail server. Using **Splunk Cloud**, I conducted a search to detect unusual login activity and potential brute-force attacks targeting the root account.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Ingestion and Indexing in Splunk**

To begin the investigation, I uploaded the provided log data (`tutorialdata.zip`) into Splunk to make it searchable. Once indexed, Splunk allowed me to query and analyze security events efficiently.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Performing a Basic Query**

To retrieve all indexed data, I executed the following Splunk query:

```splunk
index="main"
```

- **`index="main"`**: Retrieves all events from the primary index.
- Selected **All Time** as the time range to view all recorded events.

This search retrieved **thousands of events**, which were then filtered to find relevant security incidents.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluating the Fields**

Each log entry in Splunk contains several key fields that provide critical information:

- **host** ‚Üí The network host from which the event originated.
- **source** ‚Üí The specific log file generating the event.
- **sourcetype** ‚Üí The format or type of data being indexed.

### **Key Hosts Identified in the Logs:**
| Hostname        | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **mailsv**       | Buttercup Games' mail server |
| **www1**        | Web application server 1 |
| **www2**        | Web application server 2 |
| **www3**        | Web application server 3 |
| **vendor_sales** | Retail sales system |

### **Key Log Source Identified:**
- `/mailsv/secure.log` ‚Üí Contains authentication and authorization attempts for the mail server.

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Narrowing the Search to the Mail Server**

Since the focus was on SSH login failures on the mail server, I refined the search:

```splunk
index=main host=mailsv
```

- **`host=mailsv`** ‚Üí Filters results to only show logs from the mail server.
- This reduced the dataset to **over 9,000 events** originating from `mailsv`.

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Searching for Failed Root Logins**

To locate failed SSH logins for the **root** account, I refined the query further:

```splunk
index=main host=mailsv fail* root
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf69a321-69bd-4773-bf8b-1c3dbdabd746)


### **Explanation:**
- **`fail*`** ‚Üí Uses a wildcard to search for terms like `failure`, `failed`, etc.
- **`root`** ‚Üí Searches for events related to the root account.
- This query retrieved **over 300 security events**, highlighting repeated failed login attempts.

---

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Identifying a Distributed Brute-Force Attack**

After reviewing the search results, I observed **multiple failed password attempts** targeting the **root account via SSH**, originating from different IP addresses. This pattern indicates a **distributed brute-force attack**, where attackers use automated scripts to test different password combinations from various sources.

### **üîç Indicators of Attack:**

‚úÖ Multiple failed SSH login attempts in a short time frame.

‚úÖ Attempts originating from various IP addresses.

‚úÖ Repeated login attempts using the root account.

## **7Ô∏è‚É£ Key Takeaways and Mitigation Strategies**

By leveraging **Splunk Cloud**, I successfully:

‚úÖ Uploaded and indexed security log data.  
‚úÖ Queried and filtered logs for relevant security events.  
‚úÖ Identified suspicious SSH login attempts.  
‚úÖ Determined signs of a potential brute-force attack.

### **üöÄ Recommended Security Measures:**

- **Disable root SSH login:** Prevent direct SSH access for the root user.
- **Implement fail2ban:** Automatically block IPs after multiple failed login attempts.
- **Use SSH key authentication:** Replace password authentication with key-based authentication.
- **Monitor and alert:** Set up Splunk alerts for abnormal login activity.

### **Conclusion**
This project highlights the importance of log analysis in identifying security threats. By using Splunk, organizations can detect and mitigate brute-force attacks before they escalate into serious breaches.
